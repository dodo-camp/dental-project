  <h1 style="color:turquoise">Five Dental Care Tips For Monsoon Season</h1>
  <img class="card-img-top" src="http://www.drsunalidentalsolutions.com/resize/1469278864_Dental%20Monsoon.png.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="text-justify">The Monsoon season is the one those seasons which alleviate us from the warmth of an amplified summer. With the change
    in weather and temperature come a number of diseases and damages. Monsoon season not only brings along the most common
    diseases such as malaria, dengue, and cholera but also the severe dental problems and issues. The effect of weather change
    plays an important role in the tooth condition. Some people tend to face pain and trouble in their teeth in the monsoon
    season. So let us discuss some dental tips to follow during monsoon season: 1) CHANGE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH : Brushing your
    teeth plays a vital role in personal dental hygiene which helps in removing plaque effectively. Hence, it is of prime
    importance to maintain the correct toothbrush and replace it often with a new one and maintain it for the oral hygiene.
    When the bristles get frayed, it is the peak time to replace your brush with a new toothbrush. 2) EAT THE SEASON'S BEST
    : Always remember to stock your fridge with healthy and fresh vegetables and fruits available in the monsoon season.
    This will ensure your family is eating the healthy food which will limit them to indulge in unhealthy snacks options.
    The nutritionally beneficial fruits and vegetables in monsoon are apples, pears, strawberries, curd and oats. 3) RENEW
    YOUR FLOSS SUPPLY : The suggested floss length is 18 inches per flossing session. With a day by day flossing plan, that
    means approximately 45 feet of floss a month! So, stock up to abstain from running out. 4) KEEP A CHECK ON EXPIRY DATE
    OF MOUTHWASH : Everything comes with an expiry date and so is your mouthwash! So always use the mouthwash before its
    expiry date to get its maximum benefit and effectiveness. 5) MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DENTIST : Regular dental check-ups
    are a must for every individual. It not only keeps your teeth in a healthy state but will also indicate any early stage
    problem. So make sure to follow the above dental care tips to have that everlasting smile on your face!</p>

  <h1 style="color:turquoise">Root Canal Treatment for Kids</h1>
  <img class="card-img-top" src="http://www.drsunalidentalsolutions.com/resize/1468846588_pediatric-dentistry-.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="text-justify">If you think your child is too young to need root canal treatment, think again There is no age limit for this treatment.
    If his/her primary (baby) teeth have been injured, or if decay has advanced deep into the roots of your child's teeth,
    a root canal treatment to stabilise teeth may be needed. Root canal treatment removes infection from the pulp, the living
    tissue that is found inside the tooth's roots. The pulp contains the tooth's nerves, so tooth pain is often an indication
    that decay has moved into the pulp. When performing root canal procedures on children one must keep in mind that the
    primary teeth's root will be reabsorbed by the body . This is a normal process , on absorbtion of the primary teeth's
    root the body makes room for the permanent teeth . Injury resulting in loss of young permanent teeth can be even more
    troublesome, because neither tooth development, nor jaw growth is complete. If teeth are lost prematurely, a malocclusion
    ("mal" - bad: "occlusion" - bite) can easily result. The permanent teeth take the place of primary teeth , as the child
    nears the age of 6 to 7 years. Tooth replacement techniques such as partial dentures or dental implants may not necessarily
    work for children since the tooth development and jaw growth are rapidly taking place. For functional and cosmetic reasons
    ,it is best to opt for an endodontic or in layman term root canal treatment in case of young patients who are experiencing
    tooth decay or infection . When a child experience tooth pain when consuming something hot or cold , or , sweet and acidic
    foods, in such cases it can be said that the infection may be minor and can be easily treated. However if the child experiences
    pain constantly or throbbing pain regardless of stimulus , it may be the indicator of an extensive infection in the pulp
    and the surrounding area . In the event of a fall if a baby's teeth are injured , the teeth may develop discoloration.
    The discoloration may vary from yellow to dark grey. Discoloration is an indicator of injury to the pulp tissue inside
    the tooth's root . Dark Gray discoloration often indicates that the pulp tissues have died. In such cases root canal
    treatment is needed to remove the dead tissue. If a tooth is completely knocked out of the child's mouth, most dentists
    agree that it should not be replanted because of the risk of damage to the developing tooth underneath. Root canal treatment
    for baby teeth is a better choice than tooth removal if at all possible. It helps a child retain full function of their
    teeth, jaws and tongue, preventing speech problems, and it helps guide the permanent teeth into their proper places.
    smile on your face!</p>

  <h1 style="color:turquoise">Dental Implants</h1>
  <img class="card-img-top" src="http://www.drsunalidentalsolutions.com/resize/1400246579_dr%20sunali-dental-implant.jpg" alt="">
  <span class="text-justify">Dental implants are a wonderful thing. Theyâ€™re loved by dentists and patients because of their longevity, natural appearance
    and ability to restore function to speaking and eating. But how much do you really know about dental implants? You might
    know the basic facts about the dental implant procedure and how much they cost, but there are several other fun, interesting
    and obscure facts you may not know. Here are five dental implant facts:
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li>1. Dental implants have the highest success rate of any tooth replacement solution.Other tooth replacement solutions
        like bridges, crowns and dentures have a shelf life. Crowns and bridge can last anywhere from five to 10 years, while
        dentures may need to be replaced or adjusted after seven years. Also, even if a bridge, crown or denture lasts a
        while, it may not be successful when it comes to eating, drinking or speaking. Dental implants, on the other hand,
        last forever, have a 98% success rate and give you all the function and look of your natural teeth.</li>
      <li>2. Dental implants canâ€™t get cavities. Itâ€™s a common question by people considering dental implants: can my implant
        get cavities? In short, no. Since itâ€™s made out of an artificial material, it canâ€™t decay like your natural teeth.
        Itâ€™s still important to clean the gums and teeth around the implant, however.</li>
      <li>3. Dental implants are made from the same material used by NASA. Did you know the titanium used in most dental implants
        is the same type of metal used in space shuttles, rockets and guided missiles? Titanium and titanium alloy are stronger
        and lighter than steel, ensuring your implant will last a lifetime.</li>
      <li>4. Dental implants make your jawbone stronger than ever. Because they donâ€™t fuse to the bone in your mouth, teeth
        replacement solutions like bridges and dentures actually weaken your jawbone. Dental implants strengthen it due to
        the fact titanium has biologically fusing properties associated with it that spur bone growth.</li>
      <li>5. You can get dental implants at any age. You can get a dental implant whether youâ€™re 16 or 86. As long as your
        mouth is healthy, your teeth are done growing and a dentist deems you an ideal candidate, you can get dental implants
        at any age.</li>
    </ul>
